%   This is an example code to use Weighted Pseudo Inverse method for
%   spectral estimation. In this code the default reference reflectance
%   database is used and it is divided into test sets and training sets
%   using K cross validation. Running this code will calculate the estimated 
%   spectra, the mean colour difference and the mean root mean square difference
%   of each test set.
